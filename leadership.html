                    <h3> Cornell University | Pole Posse </h3>
                    <p> Pole Posse is a dance club at Cornell. 
                        Shortly after joining the club, I handled the finances and scheduling as Treasurer from January 2019 until January 2020. 
                        As Treasurer, I also helped organize a charity performance to raise over $1,500, through ticket sales, for Planned Parenthood. 
                        I started co-teaching dance workshops 2-3 times a week for current members and Cornell students in the Spring of 2019 as well.
                        Later in the fall of 2019, I worked together with the rest of the club's leadership to obtain a sponsorship from X-Pole, one of the leading aerial arts equipment companies. 
                        That same fall, I organized an additional showcase to raise money for new club equipment. For this show, I helped book rooms, organized practices, and managed ticket sales. 
                        As of January 2020, I manage all communications between the club and the Cornell community.
