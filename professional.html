                    <h3> Spectrum | Pipeline UI </h3>
                    <p> While working at Spectrum, I created a user interface for my team. 
                        My team was working on a CI/CD pipeline and wanted the pipeline to have it's own UI. 
                        I  had the opportunity to design and implement the UI on my own, which allowed me to practice both my design skills and technical skills. 
                        The UI I created allowed the user to run the whole pipeline, or any individual job in the pipeline. 
                        The user was also able to view currently building tasks and previously built tasks as well. 
                        I included a loading page for the user to see which task was running, and a results page for the user to see the outcome of the task. 
                        I learned many new things about Flask, especially using requests when running jobs and retrieving results. 
                        Using HTML/CSS and Flask, I was able to develop a more aesthetically pleasing platform for my team to run their pipeline on.
