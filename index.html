				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p> I am a senior in the College of Engineering at Cornell University. 
					I am majoring in Information Science, Systems, and Technology with a specialization in Information Science, and minoring in Computer Science.
					My primary interests are in web development and data science. 
					In the summer of 2020, I worked as a software developer for Spectrum, creating a user interface for my team. 
					Working on this project helped me refine my web development skills and solidify my passion for web development. 
					As the Treasurer and Internal Communications Officer in a dance club at Cornell, I have gained valuable leadership skills.
