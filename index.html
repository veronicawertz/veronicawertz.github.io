				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p> I am a senior in the College of Engineering at Cornell University. 
					I am majoring in Information Science, Systems, and Technology with a specialization in Information Science, and minoring in Computer Science.
					My primary interests are in web development and data science. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the summer of 2020, I worked as a software developer for Spectrum, creating a user interface for my team. 
					Working on this project helped me refine my web development skills and solidify my passion for web development.
				</p>
				<p> 
					In addition to my technical skills, I have had the opportunity to develop my leadership skills as the Treasurer and Internal Communications Officer of one of Cornell's dance clubs.
