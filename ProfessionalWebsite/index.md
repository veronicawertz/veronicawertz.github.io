				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p> Hi! I am a senior in the College of Engineering at Cornell University. 
					I am majoring in Information Science, Systems, and Technology with a specialization in Information Science, and minoring in Computer Science.
					My primary interests are in web development and data science. 
					In the summer of 2020, I worked as a software developer for Spectrum, creating a user interface for my team. 
					Working on this project helped me refine my web development skills and solidify my passion for web development. 
					Outside of my academic and professional interests, I am a leader of a dance club at Cornell, and do aerial arts in my free time!

					<h3> Spectrum | Pipeline UI </h3>
					<p> While working at Spectrum, I created a user interface for my team. 
						My team was working on a CI/CD pipeline and wanted the pipeline to have it's own UI. 
						I  had the opportunity to design and implement the UI on my own, which allowed me to practice both my design skills and technical skills. 
						The UI I created allowed the user to run the whole pipeline, or any individual job in the pipeline. 
						The user was also able to view currently building tasks and previously built tasks as well. 
						I included a loading page for the user to see which task was running, and a results page for the user to see the outcome of the task. 
						I learned many new things about Flask, especially using requests when running jobs and retrieving results. 
						Using HTML/CSS and Flask, I was able to develop a more aesthetically pleasing platform for my team to run their pipeline on.

					<h3> Cornell Pole Posse Website </h3>
					<p> 
						I created a website for my dance group, Cornell Pole Posse.
						The club never had a website before, as it is a fairly small and newly revived club at Cornell. 
						This project started as a class project, but ended up being a passion project I worked on outside of class. 
						This website was the first website I created on my own. 
						I used HTML/CSS and PHP to create this website.  
						It includes general information about the club, information about practices, and a calendar of the club's events.
