                        <p> 
                            In this project, I worked in a team to create a Subreddit Recommender web application. 
                            Reddit has a very large number of subreddits, so it can be overwhelming to be a new Reddit user. 
                            Our goal with this app was to help people who are unfamiliar with Reddit find where they should post a post. 
                            This app took a potential Reddit post and title as input. 
                            As the output, it recommended subreddits that the post would belong in. 
                            We created basic recommendations, using cosine similarity on the input posts and sample posts from many different subreddits. 
                            We used lemmatization and sentiment analysis to improve the results in our final version of the application. 
                            In this project, my main roles were to use Python, Flask, and HTML/CSS to implement cosine similarity between posts and develop the user interface. 
                            Below is an image of the Subreddit Recommender UI with sample input and our final results.

                    <h3> Spectrum | Pipeline UI </h3>
                    <p> While working at Spectrum, I created a user interface for my team. 
                        My team was working on a CI/CD pipeline and wanted the pipeline to have it's own UI. 
                        I  had the opportunity to design and implement the UI on my own, which allowed me to practice both my design skills and technical skills. 
                        The UI I created allowed the user to run the whole pipeline, or any individual job in the pipeline. 
                        The user was also able to view currently building tasks and previously built tasks as well. 
                        I included a loading page for the user to see which task was running, and a results page for the user to see the outcome of the task. 
                        I learned many new things about Flask, especially using requests when running jobs and retrieving results. 
                        Using HTML/CSS and Flask, I was able to develop a more aesthetically pleasing platform for my team to run their pipeline on.

                        <h3> Cornell Pole Posse Website </h3>
                        <p> 
                            I created a website for my dance group, Cornell Pole Posse.
                            The club never had a website before, as it is a fairly small and newly revived club at Cornell. 
                            This project started as a class project, but ended up being a passion project I worked on outside of class. 
                            This website was the first website I created on my own. 
                            I used HTML/CSS and PHP to create this website.  
                            It includes general information about the club, information about practices, and a calendar of the club's events.
